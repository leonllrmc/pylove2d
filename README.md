# pylove2d

## Introduction ##

pylove2d is a python 3 implementaton of the [Love2d][] API using pysdl2-cffi
and libsdl2 for the heavy lifting. It is intended as a replacement to
Pygame.

The interface aims to be as close to the original Love2d API as possible.
Some variance make occur due to difference between Lua and Python, or due
to the underlying implementation.

NOTE: This is not an official Love2d project.

## Status ##

pylove2d is under heavy development. The TODO.org file has status of the
various modules currently underway. If a module is not listed, it hasn't
been started yet.
